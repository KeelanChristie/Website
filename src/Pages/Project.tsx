        <h2>BSc Final Year Project</h2>  
        <p>
        Zephyr is a practical solution for managing dust in workspaces where cleanliness is essential. This compact, lap-mounted device uses a high-speed motor to draw in dust and debris, keeping your workspace clear without frequent interruptions. The design channels dust directly into a collection chamber, which can be easily emptied with a quick twist, making cleanup simple and efficient. Zephyr is built to support uninterrupted workflow and maintain a tidy environment for any creative or technical task.

        <h2>Film Prop: Sci-Fi Wheelchair</h2>
        <p>
        During my Co-op placement I was contacted by the Emerging Limerick Filmmakers (ELF), as they needed a Sci-fi wheelchair and a few other small props for a short film they were making called Mob The Trench.
        I began by sourcing an actual wheelchair as well as an old antique wooden chair. So I could now shop up the chair and mounted to the wheelchair base. I then began with some sketches that went back and forth between ELF and myself, until we found a design we were both happy with.

        I started into some woodwork making a fictional life support system. This had several custom designed dials and gauges, made from 3D Printed and laser cut parts. I sourced all the materials myself to fully fabricate the entire prop. 
        I finished it with a lot of weathering and washes until I was happy with it. 
        Once it was finished I delivered it to the set where I spent the first two days of filming working with the crew, resetting and preparing the wheelchair so it worked with the actor. I was so pleased with how it came out and felt a lot of pride seeing it in the finished film.

        <h2>Designing Headphones</h2>
        <p>
        This project was centred around learning clay modelling for quick concept iterations.
        I had to use sketching and clay modelling to create a headset for a fictional company (our company prompt was modern nostalgia).
        My process began with Mood Boarding ideas and moved to quick iterations of form using Affinity Designer.

        <p>
        I then began clay moddelling, with several iterations until i found a design I liked.
        As building the company identity was a team project, we decided upon a name and location for the company, and I designed the logo. The company was called Odio.
        Finally I mocked-up an instruction manual for how I invisioned the headphones might function.

        <h2>Fixperts - Design Challenge</h2>
        <p>
        This innovative roller device was created by my teammate and me to help my sister, who struggles with arthritis-related foot pain and inflammation. Developed as part of the Fixperts Challenge, we designed, prototyped, and refined the tool with a focus on comfort and effectiveness. The roller allows users to gently massage the muscles in their feet, helping to reduce pain, promote circulation, and ease inflammation. This accessible, at-home solution empowers people like my sister to manage arthritis discomfort independently, enhancing their mobility and overall quality of life.
